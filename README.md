# remodule

ðŸš§ This project is very new! Perhaps it will never reach a state of maturity, it does not yet reach all of its goals, and is not guaranteed to work.

Remodule is a library for managing, loading and re-loading (hot-reloading) C++ modules at run-time. Modules in this case refer to shared libraries, DLLs, etc.

It aims to encourage a programming paradigm of completely modular software architecture, where modules can be added/removed from software at any time (even at run-time!), enabling fast iteration and feature selection.

More concretely, this library is used for managing and hot-reloading components in a game engine, however it is a general-purpose library and contains no code specific to the games industry.
